CS 372 Program Assignment Queue Program Interleave the first half of the queue with second half My Encoding Algorithm Following are the steps used to encode a list of words: 1. Push the first half elements of queue to stack. 2. Enqueue back the stack elements. 3. Dequeue the first half elements of the queue and enqueue them back. 4. Again push the first half elements into the stack. 5. Interleave the elements of queue and stack. Your problem is to decode the encoded data. The input will be "wordlist.txt" which consists of a list of words that have been encoded as described above. Restrictions: You must use aggregate Stack and Queue class. To solve this problem, you can have ONE Queue and ONE Stack and only one of each. The input data will be loaded into a Queue to start with and from the Queue start your algorithm to decode the text. (Decoding as you read in your data will not be acceptable.) loop cin >> str; yourqueue.enqueue(str); endloop
