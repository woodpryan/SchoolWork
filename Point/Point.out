Ryan's point = (1.0, 2.5)
Joe's Point = (-3.0, -7.3)
Ryan's Point shifted by (x = -1, y = 2) = (-1.0, 4.5)
Ryan and Joe's Points added = 
(-1.0, 4.5) + (-3.0, -7.3) = (-4.0, -2.8)

Ryan's point rotated 90 degrees = (4.5, 1.0)

Ryan's point rotated another 90 degrees = (1.0, -4.5)

Joe's Point = (-3.0, -7.3) and Ryan's Point = (1.0, -4.5)
The midpoint between these points is (-1.0, -5.9)
The distance between Ryan and Joes Points is 4.9

newPoint and otherPoint are equal
newPoint is less than or equal to otherPoint
otherPoint shifted by 1
newPoint is now not equal to otherPoint
otherPoint is greater than or equal to newPoint
